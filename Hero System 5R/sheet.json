This sheet does not take advantage of repeating fieldsets in order to preserve the layout. Includes Targeting, Hit location tables and a roll template for Hit locations. Not intended for character generation. To call the hit location template use this call in a macro: &{template:location}{{hitlocation=[[3d6]]}}"
